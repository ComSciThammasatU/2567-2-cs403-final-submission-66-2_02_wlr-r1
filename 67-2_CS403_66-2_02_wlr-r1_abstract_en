โมบายแอปพลิเคชันสำหรับหมู่บ้านจัดสรร (หมู่บ้านฉัตรหลวง16)
Mobile application for housing developments (Chat Luang 16)
Living in a housing estate requires shared rules and fairness among residents. To ensure effective management and convenience, a juristic housing body was established to oversee community operations. Residents are entitled to share benefits such as green spaces, swimming pools, gyms, and cleaning of common areas. In return, they are required to pay a monthly common area maintenance fee.
However, due to a promotional offer from the housing project, residents were exempt from paying this fee for the first two years. As a result, many residents tend to forget the payment date when the exemption period ends, leading to loss of access to communal facilities.
This project aims to address this issue by developing a mobile application that notifies residents of upcoming payment due dates. The application also provides useful information, allows residents to submit proof of payment, and enables the juristic office to verify transactions more efficiently.
The developers hope this mobile application will help reduce missed payments, serve as a communication channel between residents and the juristic office, and promote awareness of the benefits of paying common area fees.
